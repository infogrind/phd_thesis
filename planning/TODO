o Reconcile definition of optimal code with Gastpar's thesis.
o Mention alternative names/optimality definitions such as OPTA.
o Add definition of D and P as general average cost and distortion, as far as it
  is required.
o Adapt the lemma connecting sufficiency and a product distribution of the
  backward test channel to the feedbackfree case (or omit it completely).
o Complete argument that we can always restrict the encoders to deterministic
  ones for an optimal system. (Could we even say that I(X^n;Y^n|S^k) can always
  improve a system by using a deterministic encoder instead of a random one?
