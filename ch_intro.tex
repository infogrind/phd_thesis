\chapter*{Introduction}

A very important point we need to make already in the introduction is that the
quantize\slash uncoded scheme from Chapter~\ref{ch:qescheme} occurs naturally
because of the insights from the feedback case: we can only transmit uncoded
when we know the decoder state, we therefore must first encode the source with a
small error, \ie, using a discrete constellation.
