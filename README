This README file applies to the distribution version of the thesis.

This archive intentionally contains not only the dependencies but also all
generated files, in case some of the programs needed to generate a file from a
dependency are missing. 'make clean' deletes all generated files. 'make' builds
the whole thesis and 'make force' is equivalent to 'make clean' followed by
'make'. 

This file should also contain all latex dependencies to build the thesis,
including external class and style files. Not included are font files (*.tfm,
*.pfb, *.enc, ...). Also not included is the LaTeX format file and the TeX
program, this would really get too complicated.
